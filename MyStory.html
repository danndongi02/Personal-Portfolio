                                Greetings! I'm Ian Ndung'u, a proud Kenyan, born and raised amidst the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes of Kenya. I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at St. Paul's University, Kenya, navigating the unique challenges and opportunities that came with starting my studies in 2020, during the COVID era, and successfully graduating in April of this year.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-center">
                                My journey into the world of programming began back in high school, thanks to a serendipitous gift from my cousin—a humble Arduino board. That simple piece of hardware sparked a passion for creating and tinkering that has only grown over the years. From self-teaching the basics to diving deep into languages like Python and mastering frameworks such as Angular, Django, and Vue during university, my love for programming has continually evolved. This passion has naturally led me to the dynamic field of software development, where I thrive on the endless possibilities it offers.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-center">
                                In my career thus far, I've had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, including a comprehensive CRM system built with Django. Each project has been a learning journey, pushing the boundaries of my creativity and technical skills. (You can explore more about my projects on the <a href="Creations.html" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">Creations page</a>.)
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-center">
                                What fuels my enthusiasm for software development is the sheer creativity it demands. I relish the process of transforming an idea from a mere concept into a fully functional piece of software. It's this act of creation, of making something out of nothing, that keeps me hooked.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead text-center">
                                Looking ahead, my goal is to further hone my skills and become a certified fullstack software developer. Once I achieve that milestone, I aim to venture into the realms of DevOps and ultimately specialize in DevSecOps, combining development, security, and operations into a seamless process.
                            </p>

                                An interesting tidbit about me? When I need a break from programming, I often find solace in—you guessed it—more coding! It's my way of unwinding and reconnecting with the essence of what I love to do.
                            </p>
